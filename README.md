How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Keeping my code up to date is the best way to ensure function and security. Finding errors and implementing fixes is part of the ever evolving dev cycle for programs. As new functionality is required and new vulnerabilities are discovered, they need to be fixed if the program is to be used. In addition, having clean readable code as well as other coding etiquette allows future improvements by myself and others to be implemented as smoothly as possible.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Interpreting user needs involves speaking with them and translating what they want a program to be able to do into actual code. This means constant communications and updates with users for feedback and changing needs. The requirements they set should be implemented into the program on a priority basis of what they need accomplished first.

How do I approach designing software?
I start software design by thinking about what I want and/or what is required of what I am going to make. There is a planning stage where I am able to lay out logic and the general flow of the process. Once that is finished, I start to code, writing classes and methods where appropriate before I begin to integrate them into a working project. Depending on what I have, I try to test each block as I finish it to check how well it works. After all the pieces are assembled I put the program together and check its functionality, followed by testing and fixing to get it in working orer.
